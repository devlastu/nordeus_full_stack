# Island Height Guessing Game: Island GameüåäüèùÔ∏è

Welcome to the **Island Game**, a fun and interactive game where players guess which island has the highest average height on a 30x30 grid! Test your intuition and strategic thinking to identify the tallest island before you run out of attempts.

## Features
- üó∫Ô∏è **Interactive Map**: Click on the map to select your guess coordinates.
- üéØ **Limited Attempts**: Players have different amount of attempts(depending on difficulty level) to identify the island with the greatest average height.
- üîÑ **Dynamic Difficulty Levels**: Choose from *easy*, *regular*, *intermediate*, *hard*, or *master* modes.
- üìä **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your attempts and scores throughout the game.
- üî• **Immersive Feedback**: Enjoy vibrant animations and feedback based on your gameplay results.
- üöÄ **Responsive Design**: Play on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How to Play
1. Open the game in your browser.
2. Click on the map to select the coordinates of your guess.
3. Hit the **Submit Guess** button to make your choice.
4. The game will provide feedback, including your remaining attempts.
5. Win by correctly identifying the island with the highest average height. Lose if you run out of attempts.

## Difficulty Levels
Each difficulty level adjusts the number of attempts and gameplay intensity:
- **Easy**: 5 attempts
- **Regular**: 3 attempts
- **Intermediate**: 2 attempts
- **Hard**: 2 attempts, blured map
- **Master**: 1 attempt, more blured map
